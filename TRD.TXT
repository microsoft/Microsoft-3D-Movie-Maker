                        ---------------------
                        Last updated: 4/27/95
                        ---------------------

Status options:
---------------
waiting for xxx = not implemented because of a dependency
not done = ready to implement but not implemented yet
not yet reviewed = implemented but code has not been reviewed
zd = zero defect, code is reviewed and ready to test
not ready for testing = self-explanatory, "NOTE:" required to elaborate

Formatting notes:
-----------------
So that this file can be viewed with aribitrary tab stops, tabs should
appear only at the beginning of a line.  Alignment after non-tab characters
should be accomplished using spaces.  Any item in the "status" column should
be defined above in "Status options."  For additional information, add a
"NOTE:" comment on the line below the main line-item.  Try very hard to keep
line-items short enough to fit on one line.
