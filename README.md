## Building instructions

This project is unlikely to build successfully under modern hardware/software, but you can get started with compilation and get partial completed binaries. Here's what will get you going.
- Make sure this repo is checked out to a folder with a short name, ideally right on the root of a drive (i.e. C:\3d).
- You will need Visual C++ 2.0's dev tools (located under MSVC20\BIN on its installer disk) on your path. Modern compilers dislike some of the pre C++98 conventions.
- From the root of this repo, run ```setvars.bat``` you can change the values in this script to change what your build will target.
- Run nmake and you'll begin building 3d Movie Maker.
