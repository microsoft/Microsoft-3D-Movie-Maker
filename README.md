## Code cleanup

This code was restored from the Microsoft corporate archives and cleared for release.

- Developer names and aliases were removed, with the exception of current employees who worked on the
  original release who consented to keeping their names in place
- The archive consisted of several CDs, some of which were for alternate builds or products, and
  have been excluded
- The code does not build with today's engineering tools, and is released as-is.
