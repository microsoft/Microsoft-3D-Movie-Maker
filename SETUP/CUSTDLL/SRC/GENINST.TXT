RunDll setupx.dll,InstallHinfSection <section> <reboot mode> <inf name>

eg
	RunDll setupx.dll,InstallHinfSection games 2 applets.inf would install games on you machine.

There are 5 reboot modes...
#define HOW_NEVER_REBOOT  0
#define HOW_ALWAYS_SILENT_REBOOT 1
#define HOW_ALWAYS_PROMPT_REBOOT 2
#define HOW_SILENT_REBOOT        3
#define HOW_PROMPT_REBOOT        4

NeverReboot
	whatever happens the machine will not be rebooted. Its up to the client to determin if the machine should be rebooted. For setup, this means that there is a file c:\windows\wininit.ini that is not zero bytes in size.

AlwaysSilentReboot
	The user will not be asked, the machine will just reboot - MIS win (?)

AlwaysPromptReboot
	The user will be asked to Reboot the machine, Yes/No.

SilentReboot
	If setup determins that we have to reboot, we will with no user interaction

PromptReboot
	If setup determins that we have to reboot, we will ask first Yes/No.

As you can see this allows the following default association to be made to .inf files.
	c:\windows\rundll.exe setupx.dll,InstallHinfSection AutoSection 2

This will result in users being able to simply DOUBLE click on an Inf and have it install something. That means if I wanted you to beta test something, I dont need to write an install exe, just mail you the .inf that I'd be using.

------------------------------------------------------------
If you have dependencies on other INF files, we have added 
extensions to the install section format for Optional Components.

The extensions are as follows.

In an optional component section you'll add the line
Include=<inf file>
Needs=<list of needs>

They can be a comma separated lists.

As a result you'll have to construct an inf that 
contains somethings like this

[InstallMyToys]
Include=mos.inf, msmail.inf
Needs=MSMAIL, MAPI, MicrosoftNetwork

And call setupx with this section.
