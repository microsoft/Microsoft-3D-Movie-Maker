INSTALLATION ISSUES
===================================

If you installed a previous version of Microsoft Music Producer (code-named Opus), please remove the older version by deleting its directory. Any styles installed by the previous version will be replaced by updated styles.


PROGRAM FUNCTIONALITY ISSUES
===============================

For long composition (20 minutes or more) the process of composing the song may take up to a minute. During this period, you will be given a wait cursor and a status message. Although it may appear that there is no activity, there is. 

FOR BEST RESULTS...
===============================

The quality of the sound produced by Music Producer is directly related to the quality of your computer's synthesizer. For best results, you should use a high-quality wavetable synthesis sound card.
